# Summit

![screenshot](/screenshot.png?raw=true "A side view of a green stick-figure-like representation of a person, and a matching green arrow floating next to some grey polygons, that themselves evoke the idea of a mountain.")

This is a game inspired by [Mt.](https://lukeoc.itch.io/mt)

# Building/Running

1. If you haven't already, [install Rust/Cargo](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Try running `cargo run`. If that starts up program, you're set.
3. If you got an error, refer to the instructions for [raylib-rs](https://github.com/deltaphc/raylib-rs#installation). Some libraries/utilities may need to be installed. Eventually `cargo run` should work. That said as of this writing, I have only tested on Windows and Linux.
    * From a fairly fresh Ubuntu install, I got it working by running the equivalent following, in addition to what I had installed for other reasons. (circa early 2022)
        * `sudo apt-get install curl cmake libglfw3 libglfw3-dev g++`
